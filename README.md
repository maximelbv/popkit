# Popkit - **Elegant UI Components for React**

## What is this project ?

Popkit is a personal 'copy & paste' library where I store and experiment with UI components, animations, and interactivity, primarily using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.<br />
<u>**Itâ€™s not designed as a polished, production-ready solution**</u>, but rather as a sandbox for testing ideas and refining concepts.

## Can i use it ?

Feel free to use it ! While Popkit is primarily for my own use, you're welcome to explore and integrate any components you find useful. </br >
Just keep in mind that it's not actively maintained for stability or long-term support.
